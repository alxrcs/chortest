A more complex example.

Note that a parallel gateway is used by the Communication Chair, which is then joined by an exclusive gateway.
The parallel gateway sends tokens in both directions, and the exclusive gateway fires a token when either input gets a token.

Also note that the track chair participant must be started manually when doing the simulation.
